# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

## Description
In this challenge I have used inquirer, mysql and console.table to create a command line interface that prompts a user for data and views, adds, and deletes departments, roles, and employees in a database. The user will also be able to update an employee's manager in the database as well as see the total of all employee salaries combined. My current stretch goals for this application are to allow the user to view employees by manager as well as view them by their departments.

## Installation
To use this application, users must npm install <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer">Inquirer</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table">console.table</a> as well as install <a href="https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mysql/mysql-installation-guide">MySQL</a>.
